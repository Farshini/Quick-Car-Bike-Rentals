          terms that you're provided with during the booking process.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>These Terms are laid out as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Section A: General terms - about our Platform.</li>
          <li>Section B: Rental car terms - about your Rental.</li>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <p>
          The English version of these Terms is the original. If there's any

        </p>

        <h2>A3. About QUICK</h2>
        <p>
          QUICK provides and is responsible for the Platform - but not the
          Travel Experience itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are the platform that gathers vehicle rental companies in Thailand
          and Worldwide on our platform to offer an easy way for you to compare
          bookings and rent out the vehicle. The information on our Platform is
          based on what Service Providers tell us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our search results page tells you how many car rental companies might
          be right for you, based on what you’ve told us. When you book your
          car, you agree and enter into a contract with us: we’re agreeing to
          arrange and manage your booking.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you sign your Rental Agreement at the counter, you enter into a
          contract with the rental company: they’re agreeing to provide the car.
        </p>
        <p>
            .We’re here to try to help you if you need to change or cancel your Booking, or if you have any questions – before, during or after your Rental.
        </p>
        <p>
            We make money when we find you your Rental. There are two ways we do this:
we agree a commission with the rental company for our services; or
we agree the net rate with the rental company and apply our own mark-up.
Either way, we offer our customers a lot of choice at competitive prices.
        </p>
        <p>
            Plus, our Platform is free for you to use
Every rental company on our Platform is a partner, who passed all our conditions before we started working with them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Only Service Providers that have a contractual relationship with us will be displayed on our Platform. However, they may offer Travel Experiences outside our Platform as well (so what they offer on our Platform may not be exhaustive).
        </p>
        <p>
            Review: After your Rental, you’ll be asked to leave a review, which may then be:
uploaded to our Platform to help other customers make the right choice for them*
used for marketing purposes (on our Platform, on social media, in newsletters, etc.)*
shared with your rental company to help them (and us) provide an even better service**.
        </p>
        <p>
            We publish every consumer review we receive, whether positive or negative, unless it breaches our Content Standards and Guidelines. When there are multiple reviews, we’ll show the most recent ones at the top. Please note that on our app, we only show scores and not comments. * We wouldn’t use your full name or your address. ** To help the rental company improve, we would need to tell them which Rental the review is about.
        </p>
        <p>
            Prices: The rates displayed on our Platform are set by the Service Providers or by us - but we may finance rewards or other benefits out of our own pocket.
When you make a Booking, you agree to pay the cost of the Travel Experience itself and any other charges that may apply (e.g. for any extras, insurance or taxes). Taxes and fees may vary for different reasons, such as the Service Provider’s location, the pick-up location or what you’re planning to do with your Rental. Any currency conversion is for information purposes only; actual rates may vary.
        </p>
<p>
    We work with companies that provide local support services (e.g. Customer Support or account management). They don't:
control or manage our Platform
have any legal or contractual relationship with you
provide Travel Experiences
represent us, or enter into contract or accept legal documents in our name
operate as our 'process or service agents'..
</p>
        <h2>A4. Our Platform</h2>
        <p>
          We get information from Service Providers, and we could not guarantee
          that everything is accurate - but when providing our Platform, we take
          reasonable care and act with professional diligence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unless we've failed to do so, or have been negligent, we can't be held
          responsible for any errors, interruptions, or missing bits of
          information. However, we'll do everything we can to correct/fix them
          as soon as we become aware of them.
        </p>
        <p>
            We're always working to improve our customers' experience with QUICK. So sometimes, we show different people different designs, phrasings, products, etc. to find out how they react. As a result, you might not come across some services or conditions when you visit our Platform.
        </p>
<p>
    We're not a party to the terms between you and the Service Provider. The Service Provider is responsible for the Travel Experience.
We will show you the offers that are available to you.
You need to be at least 18 to use the Platform.
</p>
        <h2>A5. Our Values</h2>
        <p>
          You will: abide by Our values - Integrity, Responsibility, Respect,
          Community and Nurture comply with all applicable laws cooperate with
          any anti-fraud/anti-money laundering checks we need to carry out not
          use the Platform to cause a nuisance or make fake Bookings use the
          Travel Experience and/or Platform for their intended purpose not cause
          any nuisance or damage, and not behave inappropriately to the Service
          Provider's personnel (or anyone else, for that matter).
        </p>
        <h2>A6. Our Prices</h2>
        <p>
          When you make a booking, you agree to pay the cost of the Travel
          Experience, including any charges and taxes that may apply.
        </p>
        <p>
          Obvious errors and obvious misprints are not binding. For example: if
          you book a premium car that was mistakenly offered for 1 THB or
          others, your booking may be cancelled and we'll refund anything you've
          paid.
        </p>

        <h2>A7. Payment</h2>
        <p>
          If we organise your payment, we (or, in some cases, our affiliate)
          will be responsible for managing your payment and ensuring the
          completion of your transaction with our Service Provider. In this
          case, your payment constitutes final settlement of the 'due and
          payable' price.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the Service Provider charges you, this will usually be in person at
          the start of your Travel Experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a security deposit part, it will be on the Service provider’s
          responsibility. QUICK will not involve and cover this part. (Unless we
          change our policy in the future).
        </p>
<p>
    This does not affect your rights if you have any problems with your Travel Experience - please refer to 'What if something goes wrong?'(A13).
If you know of or suspect any fraudulent behaviour or unauthorised use of your Payment Method, please contact your payment provider as soon as possible.
</p>
        <h2>A8. Policies</h2>
        <p>
          When you make a Booking, you accept the applicable policies as
          displayed in the booking process. You'll find each Service Provider's
          cancellation policy and any other policies (about age requirements,
          security/damage deposits, pets etc.) on the Service Provider’s
          contract with customer and on our Platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you cancel a Booking or don't show up, any cancellation/no-show fee
          and any refund will depend on the cancellation/no-show policy.
        </p>
<p>
    Some Bookings can't be cancelled for free, while others can only be cancelled for free before a deadline.
</p>
<p>
    If you think you're not going to arrive on time, please contact your Service Provider and tell them when they can expect you. It's your responsibility to ensure you're on time – and if you aren't, we are not responsible for any associated costs (e.g. the cancellation of your Booking, or any fees the Service Provider may charge).
</p>
<p>
    As the person making the Booking, you are responsible for the actions and behaviour (in relation to the Travel Experience) of everyone in the group. You are also responsible for obtaining their permission before providing us with their personal data.
</p>
        <h2>A9. Privacy and Cookies</h2>

        <p>
          If you have a query or complaint, please contact our Customer Service
          team. You can do this by accessing your Booking, or through our app.
          You can help us help you as quickly as possible - by providing:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            your Booking confirmation number, your contact details, your PIN
            code (if you have one) and the email address you used when you made
            your Booking
          </li>
          <li>
            a summary of the issue, including how you'd like us to help you
          </li>
          <li>
            any supporting documents (bank statement, pictures, receipts, etc.)
          </li>
        </ul>
<p>All queries and complaints are recorded, and the most urgent ones are treated as highest priority.</p>
<p>We do try to resolve disputes with you directly, and we're not obliged to submit to any alternative dispute resolution procedures handled by independent providers.</p>
        <h2>A14. Communication with the Service Provider</h2>
        <p>
          We may help you communicate with your Service Provider, but that
          doesn't mean we're taking responsibility for the Travel Experience or
          anything the Service Provider does/doesn't do. We can't guarantee that
          they will read anything from you or that they'll do what you ask. In
          itself, the fact that you contact them or they contact you doesn't
          mean you have any grounds for legal action. If you need help, please
          contact us via our Help Centre.
        </p>

        <h2>A15. Measures against unacceptable behaviour</h2>
        <p>
          If you breach these Terms (including our values and our Content
          Standards and Guidelines) or fail to comply with applicable laws or
          regulations, we have the right to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>stop you making any bookings,</li>
          <li>cancel any Bookings you’ve already made</li>
          <li>stop you using:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>our Customer Service</li>
            <li>our Platform,</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
<p>If we cancel a Booking as a result, you may not (depending on the circumstances) be entitled to a refund. We may tell you why we've cancelled your Booking, unless telling you would (a) contravene applicable laws and/or (b) prevent or obstruct the detection or prevention of fraud or other illegal activities. If you believe we have incorrectly cancelled your Booking, please contact our Customer Service team.</p>
        <h2>A16. Limitation of liability</h2>
        <p>
          Nothing in these Terms will limit our (or the Service Provider’s)
          liability (i) when we (or they) were negligent and this led to death
          or personal injury; (ii) in case of fraud or fraudulent
          misrepresentation; (iii) in respect of gross negligence or wilful
          misconduct; or (iv) if such liability can otherwise not lawfully be
          limited or excluded.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are in breach of these Terms and/or the Service Provider’s
          terms, we won’t be liable for any costs you incur as a result.
        </p>
        <p>We are not liable for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>any losses or damages which were not reasonably foreseeable when you made your Booking or otherwise entered into these Terms; or
                any event which was reasonably beyond our control.</li>
                <li>We don’t make any promises about Service Providers’ products and services apart from what we expressly state in these Terms, for example in Section A4.</li>
                <li>To the extent permitted by law, the most that we, (or any Service Provider) will be liable for (whether for one event or a series of connected events) is your reasonably foreseeable losses or damages in connection to your Booking(s).</li>

        </ul>
<p>Just to be clear, these Terms are between you and us:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Nothing in these Terms will entitle any third party other than the Service Provider to anything.</li>
    <li>You may be protected by mandatory consumer protection laws and regulations, which guarantee you rights that no company’s terms can overrule.</li>
    <li>If there is any inconsistency between those laws and regulations and these Terms, such mandatory consumer protection laws and regulations will override.</li>
</ul>
        <h2>A17. Modification clause</h2>
        <p>
          We may make changes to these Terms. Where such changes are material,
          we will inform you in advance of such changes becoming effective,
          unless the changes are required by applicable law.
        </p>
        <p>If you do not accept the changes, please do not use our Platform.</p>
        <p>
          Otherwise, your continued use of our Platform after the effective date
          of the proposed changes will constitute your acceptance of the revised
          Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any existing Bookings will continue to be governed by the Terms that
          applied when the Booking was made.
        </p>

        <h2>B. Rental car terms</h2>
        <h2>B1. Contractual relationship</h2>
        <p>
          This Platform is operated by QUICK. The company is registered in
          Thailand. This means that you accept that the process of making a
          Booking with QUICK is governed by these Terms - although your actual
          Rental will be governed by the Rental Agreement with
        </p>
        <p>
          When you book a Rental, your Booking is either (a) with us or (b)
          directly with the Service Provider (the rental company that provides
          the car). Either way:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Our Terms govern the booking process; when we send you your Booking
            Confirmation, you'll enter a contract with us
          </li>
          <li>
            The Rental Agreement governs the Rental itself; when you sign this
            at the rental counter, you'll enter a contract with the Service
            Provider.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If there's any mismatch between these Terms and the Rental Agreement,
          the Rental Agreement will apply.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Main Driver (the person whose details are entered during the
          booking process) is the only person who can change or cancel the
          Booking, or discuss it with us - unless they tell us they nominate
          someone else to do.
        </p>

        <h2>B2. What we will do</h2>
        <p>
          QUICK provides the Platform on which Service Providers can promote and
          sell their Travel Experiences - and you can search for, compare and
          book them.
        </p>
        <p>
          QUICK doesn’t guarantee the precise make and model you're booking
          (unless we expressly say so). The phrase 'or similar' means you could
          get a similar car (i.e. the same size, with the same kind of gearbox,
          etc.). The car pictures are illustrative only.
        </p>
        <p>Once you've booked your Rental:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            we'll give the Service Provider the Booking details (e.g. the Main
            Driver's name and contact phone number)
          </li>
          <li>
            we'll confirm the Pick-up information (e.g. the Service Provider's
            contact details, and what you need to take with you).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>B3. What you need to do</h2>
        <p>
          You as a customer must provide all the information we need to arrange
          your Booking (contact details, Pick-up Time, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
          You must read and agree to comply with these Terms and the Rental
          Agreement - and acknowledge that if you breach them:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>you might have to pay additional charges</li>
          <li>your Booking might be cancelled</li>
          <li>
            the counter staff might refuse to hand over the keys at the rental
            counter.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You must check your Rental's specific requirements, as many details
          (driving licence requirements, security deposit size, paperwork
          needed, payment cards accepted, etc.) vary per Rental. So please make
          sure you carefully read:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>these Terms</li>
          <li>
            the key terms of the Rental Agreement, which you'll see while you're
            booking, and
          </li>
          <li>the Rental Agreement itself, which you'll receive at Pick-up.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You must be at the rental counter by your Pick-up Time (note that some
          Service Providers have a pick-up 'grace period' in case you are
          delayed). If you arrive after the Pick-up Time (and after the pick-up
          grace period, if any), the car may no longer be available, and you may
          not be entitled to a refund from the Service Provider. Please check
          the Rental Agreement for further information (while you're booking
          your car, please check 'Important The key terms of your Rental tell you what the Main Driver needs at Pick-up.
           You must ensure that when they get to the rental counter, they bring everything they need (e.g. driving licence, any required ID, and a credit card in their own name, with enough available funds to cover the security deposit)).
        </p>
<p>You must make sure the Main Driver is both eligible and fit to drive the car.
    You must show the counter staff each driver's full, valid driving license, which they must have held for at least 1 year (or longer, in many cases). If any driver has endorsements/points on their license, let us know as soon as you are aware of this, as the Service Provider may not allow them to drive.</p>
      <p>You must ensure that any driver with a driving license that does not expire.
        You must ensure that every driver has their own International Driving Permit (if they need one) as well as their driving license.</p>  
        <p>Note that all drivers must carry their driving license (and International Driving Permit, if they need one) at all times.
            You must ensure that every child has an appropriate child seat if they need one.</p>
            <p>You must, if anything goes wrong during your Rental (accident, breakdown, etc.):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>contact the Service Provider
                    not authorise any repairs without the Service Provider's consent (unless the Rental Agreement allows this)</li>
                    <li>keep all documentation (repair bills, police reports, etc.) to share with us / the Service Provider / an insurance company.</li>
            </ul>
    <h2>B4. Price and payment</h2>
        <p>Additional costs and fees</p>
        <p>
          In many cases, the Service Provider will charge a young driver fee for
          each driver under a certain age (e.g. 18). In some cases, they may
          charge a senior driver fee for each driver over a certain age (e.g.
          65). When booking on our Platform, you must enter the Main Driver's
          age, so we can show you details of any age-related fee(s) - which you
          would pay at Pick-up.
        </p>
        <p>
          In many cases, the Service Provider will charge a one-way fee if you
          drop the car off at a different location. If you intend to do this,
          you need to enter the drop-off location while booking, so we can tell
          you if it's possible, and show you details of any one-way fee - which
          you would pay at Pick-up.
        </p>
        <p>
          In many cases, the Service Provider will charge a cross-border fee for
          taking the car to a different country/state/island. If you intend to do this, it's vital you tell us and/or the Service Provider as soon as you can (it must be before Pick-up).
        </p>
        <p>The price of your Rental is calculated based on 24-hour units, so (e.g.) a 25-hour Rental will cost as much as a 48-hour Rental.
        </p>
        <p>If, after Pick-up, you decide you want to keep the car for longer, please contact the Service Provider. They'll tell you how much this would cost, and you'll enter a new contract with them. If you drop the car off late without agreeing this in advance, they may charge an additional fee as well.
        </p>
        <h2>Extras</h2>
        <p>1. In some cases, you'll pay for any optional extras (child seats, GPS, winter tyres, etc.) when you book your car - in which case, you're guaranteed to get them at Pick-up.</p>
     <p>2. In other cases, you'll merely request any extras when you book your car - in which case:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>you'll pay for them at Pick-up, and</li>
      <li>the Service Provider doesn't guarantee they'll be available for you.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>B5.  Amendments, cancellations and refunds</h2>
    <p>The following 'Cancellation and Amendments' terms apply to all Bookings apart from Bookings that are labelled 'non-refundable' (you cannot amend a non-refundable Booking, and you won't receive a refund if you cancel it).
    </p>
    <h2>Cancellations</h2>
    <p>
      <span style="color: red;"> 1. For a current phase, cancellation is not allowed and the booking cannot be refunded.
     *This cancellation policy may be updated or revised in the future. At QUICK, we are committed to providing our valued customers with the best possible experience and will continue to improve our policies to meet your needs.</span>
  </p>
  <p>2. The counter staff may refuse you the car if (for example):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You don't arrive on time
    </li>
    <li>You are not eligible to rent the car
    </li>
    <li>You don't have the documentation you need</li>
    <li>The main driver doesn't have a credit card in their own name, with enough available funds for the car's security deposit.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>For more on your Service Provider's rules, please refer to the 'Important Information' that's available while booking - or the Rental Agreement that you sign at the counter.
  </p>
  <p>If they refuse you the car, please call us straight away from the rental counter to cancel your Booking. </p>
  <h2>Amendments (changes to your Booking)</h2>
  <p>1. Currently you could make any changes to your booking on your own. You may need to contact QUICK to do so. However, In the future we will improve our system to allow you to make changes to your Booking anytime before you're due to pick the car up.
  </p>
  <p>2. There is no administration fee for changing your Booking, but any changes you make may affect the rental price. Sometimes, the only way we can change a Booking is to cancel it and make another one, in which case we may charge you a cancellation fee on the rental company's behalf.</p>
    <p>3. If changing your Booking would change the price or incur a cancellation fee, we will tell you in advance.</p>  
    <h2>Changes made by us
    </h2>
    <p>If we/the Service Provider need to change your Booking (e.g. if the Service Provider can't provide the car), we'll tell you as soon as we can. If you don't accept that change, you'll be entitled to cancel and claim a full refund (no matter how close the start of your Rental is) but we will have no additional liability for any direct or indirect costs you may incur (e.g. hotel rooms or taxis).
    </p>
    <h2>B6. What else do you need to know?</h2>
    <h2>General
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1. In all cases, drivers must be at least a minimum age to rent or drive a car. In some cases, they must also be below a maximum age. The limit(s) can vary by Service Provider, by location and by type of car.</li>
      <li>2. Only eligible drivers whose names appear on the Rental Agreement may drive the car.
      </li>
      <li>You must not take the car to a different country/state/island and/or drop it off at a different location without arranging this in advance.</li>
    </ul>
