              <h1>QUICK Privacy Statement</h1>
              <p>This single Privacy Statement applies to any kind of customer information we collect through all of the QUICK platforms or by any other means connected to these platforms (such as when you contact our customer service team by email).</p>
              <p>We might amend the Privacy Statement from time to time.</p>
  
              <h2>Personal data you give us</h2>
              <p>QUICK needs to ask for your information in order to book your rental such as your name, email address, payment information, home address, billing address, phone number, date and place of birth, passport and driving license information, government-issued identification (where required by law), and the names of any additional drivers.</p>
              <p>In addition, we collect information from the computer, phone, tablet, or other device you use to access our services. This includes the IP address, the browser you’re using, and your language settings. There are also situations in which we receive information about you from others or when we automatically collect other information.</p>
              <p>QUICK also collects information when you reach out to our customer service team in a different way (such as social media) for feedback or asking for help. You might also be invited to write reviews to help inform others about your car rental experience. When you write a review on the QUICK platform, we’ll collect any information you’ve included, along with your display name.</p>
              <p>If you create a user account, we’ll also store your personal settings and reviews of previous bookings. This saved data can be used to help you plan and manage future bookings or benefit from other features only available to account holders (such as incentives or other benefits). We may offer you referral programs, and participating in these will mean providing us with relevant personal data.</p>
  
              <h2>Personal data you give us about others</h2>
              <p>QUICK collects data of an additional driver and people you are making a booking on their behalf. In both those scenarios, you will provide their details as part of the booking.</p>
              <p>In some cases, you might use QUICK to share information with others. This can take the form of participating in a referral program, as described when you use the relevant feature. </p>
                <p>At this point, it’s your responsibility to ensure that the person or people you have provided personal data about are aware that you’ve done so, and that they have understood and accepted how QUICK uses their information (as described in this Privacy Statement).</p>
  
              <h2>Personal data we collect automatically</h2>
              <p>QUICK collects your data whether or not you end up making a booking. When you visit our websites or apps, we automatically collect certain information. This includes your IP address, the date and time you accessed our services, and information about your computer’s hardware and software (such as the operating system, the internet browser used, software/application version data, and your language settings). We also collect information about clicks and which pages have been shown to you.</p>
              <p>If you’re using a mobile device, we collect data that identifies the device, as well as data about your device-specific settings and characteristics, app crashes, and other system activity. When you make a booking using this kind of device, our system registers how you made your booking (on which website), and/or which site you came from when you entered the QUICK’s website or app.</p>
  
              <h2>Personal data we get from other companies</h2>
              <p>QUICK may also receive information about you from other sources. These include business partners, such as affiliate partners, subsidiaries of QUICK, and other independent third parties. Anything we receive from these partners may be combined with information provided by you.</p>
              <p>For example, QUICK services are not only made available via the QUICK app and website, but are also integrated into services of affiliate partners you can find online. When you use any of these services, you provide the booking details to our business partners who then forward your details to us.</p>
              <p>We also integrate with third-party service providers to facilitate payments. These service providers share payment information so we can administer and handle your booking, making sure everything goes as smoothly as possible for you.</p>
              <p>Additionally, we collect information that we receive a complaint from you or about you from a car rental company. We may also receive information about you in order to show you more relevant ads, such as the additional cookie data QUICK’s social media partners make available to us. Car rental companies may share information about you with QUICK. This could happen if you have support questions about a pending booking, or if disputes or other issues arise about a booking.</p>
  
              <h2>Why do we collect and use your personal data?</h2>
              <p>Your personal data may be used by QUICK for several and a variety of purposes in the following ways:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>A. Bookings:</strong> QUICK uses your personal data to make and administer your booking, and to forward the necessary details to the company that provides your car (or other product or service, such as insurance). This includes sending you communications in relation to your booking, such as confirmations, modifications, reminders, and billing (including issuing invoices). In some cases, this may also include processing your personal data to enable online check-in or processing personal data in relation to damage deposits.</li>
                  <li><strong>B. Customer service:</strong> We provide customer service from our local offices. Our customer service teams need your details to help you make a booking, for example, or to reply to any queries you may have before, during, or after your booking.</li>
                  <li><strong>C. Account facilities:</strong> When you create a user account on our platforms, this involves giving us your personal data. We use the information you give us to administer this account, allowing you to do a number of useful things. You can manage your bookings or other purchases, take advantage of special offers, and manage your personal settings and preferences.</li>
                  <li><strong>D. Marketing activities:</strong> We use your information for marketing activities. These activities include:
                      <ul>
                          <li>a. Using your contact information to send you regular news about our special offers, discounts, and updates, including details of our travel-related products and services (and/or those of our group companies or affiliate business partners).</li>
                          <li>b. Based on your information, individualized offers might be shown to you on the QUICK platform, in mobile apps, or on third-party websites/apps (including social media sites) and the content of the site displayed to you might be personalized.</li>
                          <li>c. Contacting you by phone, email, or SMS with information about insurance products that you didn’t include in your booking.</li>
                          <li>d. Inviting you to participate in promotional activities (such as sweepstakes, referral programs, or competitions). When you participate in other promotional activities, only the relevant information will be used to administer these promotions.</li>
                      </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>E. Communicating with you:</strong> QUICK might get in touch, including by email, by post, by phone, or by texting you. Which method we choose depends on the contact information you’ve previously shared. We process the communications you send to us. There could be a number of reasons for this, including:
                      <ul>
                          <li>a. Responding to and handling any requests you have made.</li>
                          <li>b. If you have started but not finished a booking online, we might contact you to invite you to continue with your booking. We believe that this additional service benefits you as it allows you to pick up the process where you left off without having to search for a car rental or fill in your booking details again.
                          </li>
                          <li>c. We might send you a questionnaire or invite you to provide a review about your experience with QUICK or the car rental company.
                          </li>
                          <li>d. Sending you other material related to your bookings, such as how to contact QUICK if you need assistance at the pick-up desk, and information that we feel might be useful to you in planning or getting the best out of your car rental. We might also send you material related to upcoming bookings or a summary of previous bookings you made through QUICK.
                          </li>
                          <li>e.  Even if you don’t have an upcoming booking, we may still need to send you other administrative messages, which could include security alerts.</li>
                          <li>f. Sending you a summary of your previous bookings.
                          </li>
                      </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>F. Market research:</strong> We sometimes invite our customers to take part in market research.</li>
                  <li><strong>G. Improving our services:</strong> We also use personal data for analytical purposes and product improvement. This is part of our commitment to making our services better and enhancing the user experience.In this case, we use data for testing and troubleshooting purposes, as well as to generate statistics about our business. The main goal here is to get insights into how our services perform, how they are used, and ultimately to optimize and customize our website and apps, making them easier and more meaningful to use.

                  <li><strong>H. Providing the best price applicable to you:</strong> When you search our apps or website to find a car rental, we process your IP address to offer you the best price for the region or country where you are based.</li>
                  <li><strong>I. Customer reviews:</strong> During and after your booking, we might invite you to submit a review. This invite asks for information about the car rental company and your experience. By completing a review, you’re agreeing that it can be displayed (as described in detail in our Terms and Conditions on, for example, our platforms, on our mobile apps, on our social media accounts and social media apps, or other channels owned, hosted, used or controlled by QUICK.</li>
                  <li><strong>J. Call monitoring:</strong> During calls with our customer service team, live listening might be carried out or calls might be recorded for quality control and training purposes. This includes the usage of the recordings for the handling of complaints, legal claims and for fraud detection. Not all calls are recorded and recordings are kept for a limited amount of time before being automatically deleted unless QUICK has determined before then that the recorded calls need to be retained for fraud investigation or legal purposes (as further described below).
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>K. Promotion of a safe and trustworthy service:</strong> To create a trustworthy environment for you, any additional drivers, QUICKs business partners and car rental companies, we continuously analyse and use certain personal data to detect and prevent fraud and other illegal or unwanted activities. Similarly, we use personal data for risk assessment and security purposes, including when you report a safety concern, or for the authentication of users and bookings. When we do this we may have to stop or put certain bookings on hold until we’ve finished our assessment.</li>
                  <li><strong>L. Legal purposes:</strong> Finally, in certain cases, we may need to use your information to handle and resolve legal claims and disputes, for regulatory investigations and compliance, to enforce our Terms and Conditions or to comply with lawful requests from law enforcement and other public authorities.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Providing your personal data to QUICK is voluntary. However, we may only be able to provide you with certain services if we can collect some personal data. For instance, we can’t process your booking if we don’t collect your name, email address, and payment details.</p>
              <p>If we use automation to process personal data which produces legal effects or significantly affects you, we will always implement the measures required to safeguard your rights and freedoms. This includes the right to obtain human intervention.</p>
  
              <h2>What third parties do we share your personal data with - and why?</h2>
              <p>There are different parties integrated into QUICK’s services, in various ways and for various reasons. The primary reason we share your data is to supply the car rental company with the relevant information to complete your booking.</p>
              <p>We also involve other parties to provide you with QUICK services. This includes, for example, financial institutions, advertisers, subsidiaries of QUICK, and other affiliates of QUICK. Or, in some cases, if we’re required to by law, we might share your data with governmental or other authorities.</p>
  
              <h2>1. Third-party service providers:</h2>
              <p>We use service providers from outside of QUICK to support us in providing our services. These include:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Customer support</li>
                  <li>Market research</li>
                  <li>Fraud detection and prevention (including anti-fraud screening)</li>
                  <li>Payment</li>
              </ul>
              <p>We use third parties to process payments, handle chargebacks, or provide billing collection services or other billing services, for which we might share information collected during the booking process.When a chargeback is requested for your booking, either by you or by the holder of the credit card used to make your booking, we need to share certain booking details with the payment service provider and the relevant financial institution so they can handle the chargeback. This may also include a copy of your booking confirmation or the IP address used to make your booking. We may share information with relevant financial institutions, if we consider it strictly necessary for fraud detection and prevention purposes.
              </p>
              <li>Marketing services
              </li>
              <p>We share personal data with advertising partners, including your email address, as part of marketing QUICK services via third parties (to ensure that relevant advertisements are shown to the right audience). We use techniques such as hashing to enable the matching of your email address with an existing customer database, so that your email address cannot be used for other purposes. 
              </p>
              <li>Advertising partners
              </li>
              <p>We use advertising partners, such as metasearch providers, to allow you to compare our offers with the offers of other companies. When you make a booking on QUICK after using an advertising partner, we will send the details of the booking that you made on QUICK to that partner. All service providers are required to continue to adequately safeguard your personal data.</p>
              <h2>2. Competent authorities:</h2>
              <p>We disclose personal data to law enforcement to the extent that it is required by law or is strictly necessary for the prevention, detection or prosecution of criminal acts and fraud, or if we are otherwise legally obliged to do so. We may need to further disclose personal data to competent authorities to protect and defend our rights or properties, or the rights and properties of our business partners.</p>
              <h2>3. Business partners:</h2>
              <p>We work with many business partners around the world. These business partners distribute or advertise QUICK services, including the services and products of our business partners. When you make a booking on one of our business partners’ websites or apps, certain personal data that you give them, such as your name and email address, your address, payment details and other relevant information, will be forwarded to us to finalise and manage your booking.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>If customer service is provided by the business partner,  QUICK will share relevant booking details with them (as and when needed) in order to provide you with appropriate and efficient support.
                </li>
                <li>When you make a booking through one of our business partners’ websites, the business partners can receive certain parts of your personal data related to the specific booking and your interactions on these partner websites. This is for their commercial purposes.
                </li>
                <li>When you make a booking on a business partners’ website, please also take the time to read their privacy statement if you’d like to understand how they process your personal data.</li>
                <li>For fraud detection and prevention purposes, we may also exchange information about our users with business partners – but only when strictly necessary.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h2>How is your personal data shared within QUICK?</h2>
              <ul>
                  <li>A. To provide services (including to make, administer and manage bookings or handle payments) and administrative support;</li>
                  <li>B. To provide customer service;</li>
                  <li>C. To detect, prevent and investigate fraudulent, other illegal activities and data breaches;</li>
                  <li>D. For analytical and product improvement purposes;</li>
                  <li>E. To provide personalized offers or send you marketing with your consent or as otherwise permitted by applicable law;</li>
                  <li>F. For hosting, technical support, overall maintenance and maintaining security of such shared data;</li>
                  <li>G. To ensure compliance with applicable laws.</li>
              </ul>
  
              <h2>How do we make use of mobile devices?</h2>
              <p>We collect and process personal data. This works in much the same way as our website, but they also allow you to benefit from the location services available on your mobile device(s).</p>
              <p>We offer free apps for a range of different mobile devices, as well as versions of our regular website that have been optimized for browsing on mobile and tablet.</p>
              <p>These apps and mobile websites process the personal details you give us in much the same way as our website does.</p>
              <p>With your consent, we may send you push notifications with information about your booking. You can also choose to grant us access to your location data or contact details in order to provide services you’ve requested. Please read your mobile device’s instructions to understand how to change your settings and control the sharing of this category of data.</p>
              <p>In order to optimize our services and marketing activities, and to make sure we give you a consistent user experience, we use something known as ‘cross-device tracking’. This can be done with or without the use of cookies. For more general information about cookies and other similar technologies.</p>
              <p>With cross-device tracking, QUICK is able to track user behaviour across multiple devices. As part of cross-device tracking, we may combine data collected from a particular browser or mobile device with data from another computer or device that is linked to it.
                In order to optimize the content of the QUICK newsletter, we combine searches and bookings made from different computers and devices.
                </p>
                <p>Personalized ads shown to you on other websites or in apps, can be offered based on your activities on linked computers and devices. By changing the cookie settings on your device, you can change your cross-device tracking settings for advertisement purposes. You should know that logging out of your QUICK account doesn’t mean that you will no longer receive personalized ads.</p>
  
              <h2>How do we make use of social media?</h2>
              <p>The use of social media may be integrated into QUICK services in various ways. These will involve us collecting some of your personal data or the social media provider receiving some of your information. If you’d like to learn more about how this information is used and exchanged, read on.
              </p>
              <p>QUICK uses social media to promote our partners’ travel-related products and services and to advertise, improve and facilitate our own services.</p>
  <p>Note that the use of social media features can result in the exchange of personal data between QUICK and the social media service provider, as we describe below. You are free not to use any of the social media features available to you.
  </p>
  <p>We may maintain social media accounts and offer apps on several social media sites. Whenever you connect with QUICK through social media, your social media service provider may allow you to share information with us. If you choose to share, you will generally be told by your social media provider which information will be shared.</p>
  <p>When you register with a QUICK social media app or connect to a social media messaging service without a QUICK user account, the information you choose to share with us may include the basic information available in your social media profile (including your email address, status updates and a list of your contacts).</p>
  <p>We’ll use this information to help provide you with the service you requested – for example, to forward a message you want to send to your contacts, or to create a personalized user experience in the app or on our websites. It means that if you want us to, we can tailor our services to suit your needs, connecting you and your friends with the best ground transport companies and analysing and improving our travel-related services.
  </p>
  <p>Your social media provider will be able to tell you more about how they use and process your data when you connect to QUICK through them. This can include combining the personal data they collect when you use QUICK through them with information they collect when you use other online platforms you have also linked to your social media account.
  </p>
              <h2>How can you control the personal data you have given us?</h2>
              <p>You have the right to review the personal data we keep about you at any time. You can request access to or deletion of your personal data by submitting a request to us.</p>
